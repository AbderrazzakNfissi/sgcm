# World Cup Management System

This is a web application developed using Laravel and the Apex RESTful services for managing the World Cup. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing teams, players, matches, and scores.

The back-end of the application was developed using Apex, while the front-end was developed using Laravel. The combination of these two technologies allowed us to create a seamless and intuitive user experience, while also leveraging the powerful features of the Apex platform.
